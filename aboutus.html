		<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
		<p>Our goal is simple. We want to provide you with the best healthiest houseplants at a fair price. Everything is grown in our own garden with love. We do not source indoor plants from third party "agents" or distributorsâ€”so our plants never experience the stress of multiple long haul shipments. Fewer middle men means none of the additional price markups between dealers common in the houseplant industry. All this adds up to better plant value for you. We believe living well with indoor plants is the future. We are fortunate to be part of a fast-growing community; a movement of people to whom engaging with the natural environment is important, and making their lives beautiful with plants is fulfilling and exciting. </p>
